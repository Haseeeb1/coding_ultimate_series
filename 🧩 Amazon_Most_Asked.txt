1. Reorder Data in Log Files
- Logic is basic, question must be clear.
- understand question in scratch before starting, that's all!

2. Sum of Subarray Ranges
- Is easy, we just need to form the subarrays and calculate max and min at each step

3. ðŸŒŸ All nodes distance k in binary tree
- Question was simple if it  was a graph
- Here difficlty is only that we need to traverse back as well
- Traversing back is not possible in tree! But with some extra work we can! How?
- Use map to store parent of each node! So that we can traverse back
- Also, make sure to use visited array so you don't come back from where traversing path for k

4. ðŸŒŸ Search Suggestion System (TRIE)
- Basic Trie Problem! Must be done before to do it timely :)

5. Find Triangular Sum of Array (Medium/Basic question)
- Basic array problem

6. ðŸŒŸ Flip String to Monotone increasing (1, 0's problem)
- Minor maths thinking, but need recursion before

7. kth factor of n
- Basic question, nothing complex

8. Diameter of Binary Tree
- Basic recursive solution

9. ðŸŒŸ Minimum swaps to group all 1's together (1, 0's problem)
- We need a group here, hence sliding window comes in picture
- We just need to maintain window of size = (total number of 1's) and count zeroes inside it
- Number of zeroes is the number of swaps required 

10. ðŸŒŸ Design and Search design words problem (TRIE PROBLEM)
- Important to understand to limit arr as per given constraints or else Memory limit will exceed
- Important to know how to build and search trie, without that can't approach the problem
- For matching '.' we need to take a recusive approach!

11. Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amount
- Logic is to note that subtracting min number from all each time is not required
